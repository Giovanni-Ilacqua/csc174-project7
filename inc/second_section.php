              <li>Ounce for ounce, crickets can provide more than twice the protein of beef. Not only are they protein
                packed, but they also provide the best kind of protein. This is because crickets contain all nine essential amino acids.</li>
              <li>Crickets also contain nearly 5x more magnesium than beef. Another incredible fact is crickets have more
                than 3x the iron that beef has, Crickets are also Paleo Certified.</li>
